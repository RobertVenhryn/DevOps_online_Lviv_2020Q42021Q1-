I've used GIT with Atom text redactor After creating an account on Github, I've tried about 7 times to implement an issue with my image. It was my biggest problem.
I tried a couple of ways to put a picture to my readme.md file.
Finally, it is working.
Branches creating and merging was made after 3-4 attempts.
Now you can see my first HTTP page. Thank you!

In my view, DevOps is something in the middle between programming and system administration. Because it requires knowledge about network technologies, OS's, programming languages, databases, virtualization, and so on.
